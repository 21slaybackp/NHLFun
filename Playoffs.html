<p style="font-size = 20px"> In the NHL the playoffs are 16 teams, 8 per conference and 4 per division. The 1st seed in each division plays the wild card and the 2nd and 3rd seeds face. It is a
best of 7 series in which the team with the better regular season record plays in their arena in games 1 2 5 and 7. Whoever gets 4 wins in the series first moves on. There are 4 total rounds and the Stanley Cup Finals rewards the best team in the playoffs.
