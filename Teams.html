<p style="font-size = 20px">Back in 1917, there were only 6 teams. These being the Montreal Canadiens, Detroit Red Wings, New York Rangers,
Toronto Maple Leafs, Boston Bruins and Chicago Blackhawks. These teams were the only teams in the NHL for 50 years! Until 1967 when they added more teams.</p></th>

<p style="font-size:20px"> 
Up until 1967 the NHL was a 6 team league, then in 1967 they added the California Golden Seals (Now Dallas Stars), Los Angeles Kings, Minnesota North Stars (Now Dallas Stars), Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsbrugh Penguins and St. Louis Blues.
There are now a total of 12 NHL teams. After this many more expansions happened to get us to our total of 31 NHL teams today.</p></th>

<!-- Third Header-->


<p style="font-size:20px;">Currently, there are 31 <a href = "https://www.nhl.com/info/teams">NHL Teams</a> and many more that no longer exist such as the Atlanta Thrashers or Hartford Whalers. These teams now compete each season for a chance to
win the Stanley Cup. However, you can imagine it's hard considering there are 31 teams!</p></th>
